\caption{Anomaly temperature relationship for $T_r$ and $T_u$. The slope $m^\prime$ of the regression between anomaly temperature $T^\prime _{r}$ and $ _uT^\prime$, $ T_u ^\prime = m^\prime T^\prime_{r} +b$, is plotted for each city in a (a) map and (b) as a histogram. For all cities, $p <0.05$.}

%slope sensitivity analysis
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{figureS2.eps}
\caption{Distribution of slope $m_{day}$ in each city when rural station selection is varied by dropping the data availability requirement for rural stations. Boxes indicate the middle two quartiles (Q2 and Q3), red lines indicate the mean, and whiskers represent the wide interquartile range (1.5*(Q3-Q2)). Crosses indicate data points beyond this range, that is, statistical outliers. The gray line denotes the mean of all cities $m_{day}$. }
